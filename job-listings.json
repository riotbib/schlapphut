    "jobRequirements": "At NSA, mathematics and statistics are core disciplines present in every aspect of our mission: to protect our Nation. The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information.\n\nMathematicians and Mathematical Statisticians contribute across our mission by bringing both subject matter expertise and creative, critical thinking.  A wide range of technical expertise finds a natural fit at NSA including, but not limited to, fields of algebra, combinatorics, Fourier analysis, operations research, graph analytics, regression, machine learning, exploratory data analysis, stochastic processes, statistical modeling, forecasting, and cryptography.\n\nDiversity is a key for NSA mission success.  We solve our hardest problems and develop innovative solutions by bringing together the perspectives of people with a wide range of backgrounds, experiences, and viewpoints. \n\nThe Agency supports a dynamic mathematics community with substantial opportunities to learn and experiment in areas far from academic training.  Additionally, professional development is supported by hands-on training, seminar series, conference travel, and professional organizations.  These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians and mathematical statisticians in the country.\n\nIn addition, send a soft copy PDF of your resume/CV and all college transcripts (to include undergraduate, graduate, and transfer transcripts).
