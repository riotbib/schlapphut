World-class technical professionals solve challenging systems engineering problems with unprecedented speed and scale utilizing innovative solutions. Systems engineers perform trade studies to generate and translate conceptual designs into technical specifications, participate in the evaluation of prototype hardware systems and software solutions, and integrate into the current architecture.  Backgrounds such as Cybersecurity, SIGINT, hybrid-cloud, machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), integrated network architecture, information technology infrastructure and hybrid-communications all have a place in the spectrum of implementations ranging from commercial/government off-the-self solutions to the development of new and unique technologies.\n\nSENIOR SYSTEMS ENGINEERS\n\nSeasoned professionals drive the Agency's largest and most challenging technical projects to ensure success. These engineers participate in technical decision-making, or function in an advisory role. Working in collaborative teams, these professionals define and manage technical requirements throughout product lifecycle; identify and manage technical program risk; evaluate the architectural design for efficiency improvements; capture, analyze and recommend updates to the enterprise and mission architectures to ensure resiliency; design and enforce configuration management and interoperability standards; and define, manage and perform testing and evaluation. Senior Systems Engineers mentor other systems engineers in their tradecraft, which lays the foundation for future successes.\n\nMID-CAREER SYSTEMS ENGINEERS\n\nMid-career systems engineers have experience leading systems engineering efforts, and are ready to apply, or expand that knowledge in the Intelligence Community. These engineers have experience in specific lifecycle phases, as well as an understanding of the full lifecycle. They develop their expertise, grow their breadth of knowledge, and mentor the next generation of systems engineers. Mid-career systems engineers come from a wide variety of experiences such as Cybersecurity, SIGINT, communications, and systems of systems or networking infrastructure. These professionals are adept at communicating with technical teams, and making recommendations to senior leadership that drive mission initiatives.\n\nJUNIOR SYSTEMS ENGINEERS\n\nNSA hires recent college graduates and junior systems engineers to support a technical mission office, or participate in a Development Program. These systems engineers are involved in various projects that are designed to nurture and grow their skills. They gain hands-on, practical knowledge of architecture and infrastructure by designing engineering systems over the lifecycle in areas such as Cybersecurity, SIGINT, networks, servers, hardware and software.
