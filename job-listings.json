World-class technical professionals solve challenging systems engineering problems with unprecedented speed and scale utilizing innovative solutions. Systems engineers perform trade studies to generate and translate conceptual designs into technical specifications, participate in the evaluation of prototype hardware systems and software solutions, and integrate into the current architecture.  Backgrounds such as Cybersecurity, SIGINT, hybrid-cloud, machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), integrated network architecture, information technology infrastructure and hybrid-communications all have a place in the spectrum of implementations ranging from commercial/government off-the-shelf solutions to the development of new and unique technologies.\n\nSENIOR SYSTEMS ENGINEERS\n\nSeasoned professionals drive the Agency's largest and most challenging technical projects to ensure success. These engineers participate in technical decision-making, or function in an advisory role. Working in collaborative teams, these professionals define and manage technical requirements throughout product lifecycle; identify and manage technical program risk; evaluate the architectural design for efficiency improvements; capture, analyze and recommend updates to the enterprise and mission architectures to ensure resiliency; design and enforce configuration management and interoperability standards; and define, manage and perform testing and evaluation. Senior Systems Engineers mentor other systems engineers in their tradecraft, which lays the foundation for future successes.\n\nMID-CAREER SYSTEMS ENGINEERS\n\nMid-career systems engineers have experience leading systems engineering efforts, and are ready to apply, or expand that knowledge in the Intelligence Community. These engineers have experience in specific lifecycle phases, as well as an understanding of the full lifecycle. They develop their expertise, grow their breadth of knowledge, and mentor the next generation of systems engineers.

The answer changes daily, but always involves solving difficult problems and keeping pace with, or even establishing, the state of the art in software development and system security. The majority and widest variety of opportunities are in our Fort Meade, MD location, and limited opportunities in Fort Gordon, GA; Aurora, CO; and HI.\n\nMake an IMPACT! As a Software Engineer at NSA, the creativity of you and your team is essential to engineering and maintaining effective solutions for internal and Agency-supported customers around the world.  Your efforts will drive global impacts that may include: saving lives of U.S. and ally soldiers; providing U.S. policy and decision makers with critical, timely intelligence; ensuring the continued safety of U.S. citizens and residents by thwarting foreign adversaries; and defending vital networks. Whether your focus is Counter-Terrorism, Cybersecurity, Foreign Intelligence, or providing support to other Intelligence Community agencies, you can take pride in knowing your efforts are protecting others, rather than stuffing a balance sheet.\n\nEntry level Software Engineers may have the opportunity to start in either the Applied Computing or Cybersecurity Engineering Development Programs (ACDP, CSEDP), where you will rotate through a variety of teams every six to nine months during a three year program. These programs jumpstart your career by providing access to structured training and exposing you to a broad range of mission focus areas, so you can explore where you want to specialize.  Please indicate as you apply if a DP may appeal to you.\n\n*We strongly encourage you to upload transcripts as you apply for qualification verification.*",
