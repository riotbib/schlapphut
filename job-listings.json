These components are typically subsystems of communication, collection, processing or analysis systems. \n\nHardware Software Engineers utilize electrical, computer, mechanical, and materials engineering knowledge and skills to design, assemble, test, analyze and reverse engineer electronics hardware in support of the NSA mission.\n\nThe National Security Agency (NSA) currently has opportunities for two types of Hardware/Software Engineers positions: Hardware/Software Design Engineers, and Hardware/Software Analysis Engineers. Applicants may also be considered for NSA Development Programs. \n\n1.  HARDWARE/SOFTWARE DESIGN ENGINEERS are hired into positions supporting a broad range of specialized skills including Computer Engineering, Computer Programming, Computer Software Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Communications Engineering. Positions will be in an office directly supporting a technical mission. \n\nThe responsibilities of a Hardware/Software Design Engineer may include: \n-  Designing, developing, testing, and/or evaluating computer or computer-related equipment. \n-  Designing, developing, testing and evaluation of programmable hardware devices or digital circuits.\n-  Programming, modifying and/or configuring system software that manages the computer hardware and provides services to the applications.\n-  Applying software engineering principles to design, develop, test, and evaluate/modify software applications.\n\n2.  HARDWARE/SOFTWARE ANALYSIS ENGINEERS are hired into positions supporting a broad range of specialized skills including Computer Science, Software Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Telecommunications Engineering and Applied Mathematics. Positions will be in an office directly supporting a technical mission.\n\nThe responsibilities of a Hardware/Software Analysis Engineer may include: \n-  Design, develop, construct, test, or analyze firmware, hardware or software components.\n-  Develop new or utilize existing methods and tools to analyze or protect specific hardware, software or firmware. \n-  Develop/recommend mitigation strategies and techniques.\n-  Develop and implement hardware forensic methodologies and applications.\n-  Test, evaluate and/or reverse engineer microelectronic components (FPGA, ASICs, PCB, Microcontrollers, etc.), technology and equipment. \n-  Program, modify and analyze system software/tools that control microelectronics hardware.\n-  Apply hardware and software engineering principles to design, develop, test, and evaluate/modify applications and systems.\n \nNSA DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\nApplicants may be considered for one of three Development Programs: the Resident Signals Engineering Program (RSE), System Engineer Development Program (SEDP) or the Applied Computing Development Program (ACDP).\n\n1.  The RSE Program is a 4-year technical development program focused on the collection, processing, and analysis of signals in any environment and in any media. The RSE Program offers selected technical personnel unique opportunities for self-directed diversity tours in core mission areas where they will learn about, and provide solutions for, many of the toughest technical problems facing the Agency. \n\n2.  The SEDP prepares recent college graduates (engineering-related degrees) for a career in systems engineering at NSA. Applying systems engineering tradecraft and building a network while working with leading NSA experts prepares SEDP engineers for advanced or leadership assignments. The SEDP covers the breadth of systems engineering core competencies, including technical/analytical, technical management, and organizational/business processes. During the three-year full-time program, SEDP engineers rotate assignments to gain exposure to various NSA mission areas, attend systems engineering training and visits throughout the IC, and earn DoD DAWIA and other important credentials. \n\n3.
