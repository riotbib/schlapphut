The program includes 4-5 operational tours in a variety of offices, interspersed with formal classroom and computer-based training. These on-the-job operational tours are primarily focused on analyzing foreign language materials within the framework of the two main SIGINT disciplines of intelligence analysis - SIGINT reporting and SIGINT development. \n\nCross-Training Program (Language Enhancement or Acquisition):\nThe Language Analysis Cross Training Program is designed to cross-train individuals in the acquisition of another language which is critically needed to fulfill NSA's mission. Optimally qualified candidates will have already demonstrated the ability to attain advanced proficiency in a foreign language as an adult learner.

    "jobRequirements": "With ever-accelerating technological advances and growing system complexity, a diverse and inclusive professional workforce of Systems Engineers builds, integrates, and optimizes complex systems and services. World-class technical professionals solve challenging systems engineering problems with unprecedented speed and scale utilizing innovative solutions. Systems engineers perform trade studies to generate and translate conceptual designs into technical specifications, participate in the evaluation of prototype hardware systems and software solutions, and integrate into the current architecture.  Backgrounds such as Cybersecurity, SIGINT, hybrid-cloud, machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), integrated network architecture, information technology infrastructure and hybrid-communications all have a place in the spectrum of implementations ranging from commercial/government off-the-self solutions to the development of new and unique technologies.\n\nSENIOR SYSTEMS ENGINEERS\n\nSeasoned professionals drive the Agency's largest and most challenging technical projects to ensure success. These engineers participate in technical decision-making, or function in an advisory role. Working in collaborative teams, these professionals define and manage technical requirements throughout product lifecycle; identify and manage technical program risk; evaluate the architectural design for efficiency improvements; capture, analyze and recommend updates to the enterprise and mission architectures to ensure resiliency; design and enforce configuration management and interoperability standards; and define, manage and perform testing and evaluation. Senior Systems Engineers mentor other systems engineers in their tradecraft, which lays the foundation for future successes.\n\nMID-CAREER SYSTEMS ENGINEERS\n\nMid-career systems engineers have experience leading systems engineering efforts, and are ready to apply, or expand that knowledge in the Intelligence Community. These engineers have experience in specific lifecycle phases, as well as an understanding of the full lifecycle. They develop their expertise, grow their breadth of knowledge, and mentor the next generation of systems engineers. Mid-career systems engineers come from a wide variety of experiences such as Cybersecurity, SIGINT, communications, and systems of systems or networking infrastructure. These professionals are adept at communicating with technical teams, and making recommendations to senior leadership that drive mission initiatives.\n\nJUNIOR SYSTEMS ENGINEERS\n\nNSA hires recent college graduates and junior systems engineers to support a technical mission office, or participate in a Development Program. These systems engineers are involved in various projects that are designed to nurture and grow their skills. They gain hands-on, practical knowledge of architecture and infrastructure by designing engineering systems over the lifecycle in areas such as Cybersecurity, SIGINT, networks, servers, hardware and software. Supported by robust training, junior systems engineers have opportunities to form relationships with mentors and explore possibilities. They are energetic, motivated, driven to continual learning and ready to grow their careers.",

These leaders have experience with advanced technologies, collaboration, and moving ideas from requirements to implementation. In the government and in today's ever changing technology environment, STEM Technical Leaders (STEMT TLs) have to be more adaptable, relatable and innovative. STEM TLs have to choose what information they keep and what information they take action on. STEM TLs have to evolve more rapidly than ever, and address the most pressing workforce cares highlighted during the post COVID era (i.e., game changing technology to provide intelligence advantage).\n\nSTEM Technical Leaders drive technical decisions, architectural design discussions, and systems integration within the context of their technical specialties coming from a full spectrum of backgrounds such as software development; systems engineering; architecture; electrical engineering; cryptography and cybersecurity engineering; networking; Nuclear Command, Control and Communication (NC3); cyber defense consulting; National Leadership Command Capabilities (NLCC); DoD Command and Control (NC2) and many more. They use their deep experience leading advancements in technology, which may be at a project or organizational level, to influence technical direction. While technical, these leaders possess skills to mediate alternative Course of Action discussions, and negotiate strategic direction across a variety of levels. These leaders know how to interpret senior leadership guidance and direction, and translate it into actionable plans, requirements, and strategies. STEM TLs have proven experience delegating resources and tasks, and transforming ideas into operational capabilities.\n\nSTEM Technical Leaders may or may not serve in a supervisory role, but they all have the opportunity to mentor junior technical colleagues. They lead by example. In vertical or horizontal teams, STEM TLs push frontiers to advance NSA mission to gather signals intelligence and protect our Nation's Defense Industrial Base and critical infrastructure. These leaders are adept at working across organizations with competing priorities to build consensus to achieve mission outcomes. These leaders actively engage in diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility efforts to advance NSA's mission; show respect and appreciation for the unique skills, knowledge, abilities and perspectives of all colleagues; model inclusive behavior that enables everyone to contribute their fullest to the mission.",
