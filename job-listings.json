The Legal Honors Program is NSA OGC's exclusive entry-level attorney hiring program. The three-year program includes rotations in both operational and support practice areas. NSA OGC has eight legal practice groups, which provide legal advice on the full breadth of legal issues confronting NSA, including legislation, intelligence operations, cybersecurity, ethics, procurement, research and development, litigation, environmental law, patents, personnel security, and employment issues. \n\nNSA OGC is seeking superior Honors Program applicants who are interested in joining its exceptional team of lawyers who provide legal advice to the Agency as it carries out its critical national security missions. Attorneys working in NSA OGC apply their expertise, skills, and education to solve a variety of challenges not found in the private sector or at any other government agency. You will have the opportunity to make a global impact on a daily basis as you work with other top caliber professionals at the highest levels of the Agency and across the U.S. Government. This critical work ensures that Agency operations comply with the law while also protecting both our national security and our civil liberties. With appropriate training and supervision, NSA Honors Program attorneys are entrusted with immediate responsibility, working directly with clients and Agency leadership. Attorneys selected for the Legal Honors Program will also have special opportunities to attend high-level briefings, meetings, and congressional hearings on national security issues, liaise directly with intelligence community partners and other federal agencies, and tour facilities throughout the intelligence community, all while working under the guidance and mentorship of a senior attorney assigned to them from among the leadership of NSA OGC.\n\nThe twin missions of NSA - signals intelligence and cybersecurity - are two of the most important and dynamic challenges our Government faces today; therefore, there is rarely a typical day for an NSA attorney. At NSA OGC, you will analyze cutting-edge technical and intelligence issues and will frequently provide legal advice that relates to high-profile current events affecting our national security. In tackling these challenges, our attorneys work directly with senior officials at the Department of Justice's National Security Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Council at the White House, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the Department of Defense, as well as other agencies in the Executive Branch and relevant committees of Congress.\n\nNSA attorneys work in a highly classified setting and are entrusted with tremendous responsibility as they advise the Director and other senior leaders at the Agency on a diverse and complex spectrum of issues related to gathering the foreign intelligence information needed to fight international terrorism, espionage, transnational crime, and narcotics; defeating foreign cyber adversaries trying to steal national secrets; and providing intelligence support to critical military overseas tactical operations, all while protecting our civil liberties and ensuring strict compliance with the Constitution and our laws. Because the NSA is a Department of Defense agency, our attorneys have a unique opportunity to be directly involved in national security operations working alongside military and civilian colleagues, as well as to interact with the private sector in cybersecurity and other matters.",
