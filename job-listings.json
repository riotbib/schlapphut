    "jobRequirements": "With ever-accelerating technological advances and growing system complexity, a diverse and inclusive professional workforce of Systems Engineers builds, integrates, and optimizes complex systems and services. World-class technical professionals solve challenging systems engineering problems with unprecedented speed and scale utilizing innovative solutions. Systems engineers translate conceptual designs into technical specifications, participate in the evaluation of prototype system and software solutions, and integrate into the current architecture.  Backgrounds such as hybrid-cloud, machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), integrated network architecture, radio frequency (RF), satellite systems, information technology infrastructure and hybrid-communications all have a place in the spectrum of implementations ranging from commercial/government off-the-self solutions to the development of new and unique technologies.\n\nSENIOR SYSTEMS ENGINEERS\nSeasoned professionals drive the Agency's largest and most challenging technical projects to ensure success. These engineers participate in technical decision-making, or function in an advisory role. Working in collaborative teams, these professionals define and manage technical requirements throughout product lifecycle; identify and manage technical program risk; reduce architectural design complexity for efficiencies; capture, analyze and recommend updates to the enterprise and mission architectures to ensure resiliency; design and enforce configuration management and interoperability standards; and define, manage and perform testing and evaluation. Senior Systems Engineers mentor other systems engineers in their tradecraft, which lays the foundation for future successes.\n\nMID-CAREER SYSTEMS ENGINEERS\nMid-career systems engineers have experience leading systems engineering efforts, and are ready to apply, or expand that knowledge in the Intelligence Community. These engineers have experience in specific lifecycle phases, as well as an understanding of the full lifecycle. They develop their expertise, grow their breadth of knowledge, and mentor the next generation of systems engineers. Mid-career systems engineers come from a wide variety of experiences such as telecommunications, signals, systems or networking. These professionals are adept at communicating with technical teams, and making recommendations to senior leadership that drive mission initiatives.\n\nJUNIOR SYSTEMS ENGINEERS\nNSA hires recent college graduates and junior systems engineers to support a technical mission office, or participate in a Development Program. These systems engineers are involved in various projects that are designed to nurture and grow their skills. They gain hands-on, practical knowledge of architecture and infrastructure by designing engineering systems over the lifecycle in areas such as networks, servers, hardware and software. Supported by robust training, junior systems engineers have opportunities to form relationships with mentors and explore possibilities.

    "jobRequirements": "At NSA, mathematics and statistics are core disciplines present in every aspect of our mission: to protect our Nation. The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information.\n\nMathematicians and Mathematical Statisticians contribute across our mission by bringing both subject matter expertise and creative, critical thinking.  A wide range of technical expertise finds a natural fit at NSA including, but not limited to, fields of algebra, combinatorics, Fourier analysis, operations research, graph analytics, regression, machine learning, exploratory data analysis, stochastic processes, statistical modeling, forecasting, and cryptography.\n\nDiversity is a key for NSA mission success.  We solve our hardest problems and develop innovative solutions by bringing together the perspectives of people with a wide range of backgrounds, experiences, and viewpoints. \n\nThe Agency supports a dynamic mathematics community with substantial opportunities to learn and experiment in areas far from academic training.  Additionally, professional development is supported by hands-on training, seminar series, conference travel, and professional organizations.  These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians and mathematical statisticians in the country.",

Applicants may also be considered for NSA Development Programs. \n\n1.  HARDWARE/SOFTWARE DESIGN ENGINEERS are hired into positions supporting a broad range of specialized skills including Computer Engineering, Computer Programming, Computer Software Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Communications Engineering. Positions will be in an office directly supporting a technical mission. \n\nThe responsibilities of a Hardware/Software Design Engineer may include: \n-  Designing, developing, testing, and/or evaluating computer or computer-related equipment. \n-  Designing, developing, testing and evaluation of programmable hardware devices or digital circuits.\n-  Programming, modifying and/or configuring system software that manages the computer hardware and provides services to the applications.\n-  Applying software engineering principles to design, develop, test, and evaluate/modify software applications.\n\n2.  HARDWARE/SOFTWARE ANALYSIS ENGINEERS are hired into positions supporting a broad range of specialized skills including Computer Science, Software Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Telecommunications Engineering and Applied Mathematics. Positions will be in an office directly supporting a technical mission.\n\nThe responsibilities of a Hardware/Software Analysis Engineer may include: \n-  Design, develop, construct, test, or analyze firmware, hardware or software components.\n-  Develop new or utilize existing methods and tools to analyze or protect specific hardware, software or firmware. \n-  Develop/recommend mitigation strategies and techniques.\n-  Develop and implement hardware forensic methodologies and applications.\n-  Test, evaluate and/or reverse engineer microelectronic components (FPGA, ASICs, PCB, Microcontrollers, etc.), technology and equipment. \n-  Program, modify and analyze system software/tools that control microelectronics hardware.\n-  Apply hardware and software engineering principles to design, develop, test, and evaluate/modify applications and systems.\n \nNSA DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\nApplicants may be considered for one of three Development Programs: the Resident Signals Engineering Program (RSE), System Engineer Development Program (SEDP) or the Applied Computing Development Program (ACDP).\n\n1.  The RSE Program is a 4-year technical development program focused on the collection, processing, and analysis of signals in any environment and in any media. The RSE Program offers selected technical personnel unique opportunities for self-directed diversity tours in core mission areas where they will learn about, and provide solutions for, many of the toughest technical problems facing the Agency. \n\n2.  The SEDP prepares recent college graduates (engineering-related degrees) for a career in systems engineering at NSA. Applying systems engineering tradecraft and building a network while working with leading NSA experts prepares SEDP engineers for advanced or leadership assignments. The SEDP covers the breadth of systems engineering core competencies, including technical/analytical, technical management, and organizational/business processes. During the three-year full-time program, SEDP engineers rotate assignments to gain exposure to various NSA mission areas, attend systems engineering training and visits throughout the IC, and earn DoD DAWIA and other important credentials. \n\n3.  The ACDP is a three-year full-time development program designed to provide entry-level information technology specialists (that is, individuals with degrees in computer science, engineering, computer security, information systems, information technology, and related degrees and experience) the opportunity to acquire the skills and technical capabilities necessary to successfully execute NSA's mission. In this program, participants gain a depth of knowledge in a breadth of information technology disciplines, including system/security, software engineering, software project management, and system architecture. ACDP participants work in teams and with NSA technical leaders to solve current and future challenging IT problems.",
