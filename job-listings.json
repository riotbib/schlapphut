These leaders have experience with advanced technologies, collaboration, and moving ideas from requirements to implementation. In the government and in today's ever changing technology environment, STEM Technical Leaders (STEMT TLs) have to be more adaptable, relatable and innovative. STEM TLs have to choose what information they keep and what information they take action on. STEM TLs have to evolve more rapidly than ever, and address the most pressing workforce challenges highlighted during the post COVID era (i.e., game changing technology to provide intelligence advantage).\n\nSTEM TLs drive technical decisions, architectural design discussions, and systems integration within the context of their technical specialties coming from a full spectrum of backgrounds such as software development; systems engineering; architecture; electrical engineering; cryptography and cybersecurity engineering; networking; Nuclear Command, Control and Communication (NC3); cyber defense consulting; National Leadership Command Capabilities (NLCC); DoD Command and Control (NC2), innovation of critical and emerging technologies, and many more. They use their extensive experience leading advancements in technology, which may be at a project or organizational level, to influence technical direction. \n\nAlthough primarily technical, STEM TLs will possess skills to mediate alternative Course of Action discussions, negotiate strategic direction, and drive innovation across a variety of levels. These leaders know how to interpret senior leadership guidance and direction, and translate it into actionable plans, requirements, and strategies. STEM TLs have proven experience delegating resources and tasks as well as, transforming ideas into operational capabilities.\n\nWhile STEM TLs may or may not serve in a supervisory capacity; they will bear the responsibility of leading, mentoring, and developing the next generation of technical experts.  In vertical or horizontal teams, STEM TLs push frontiers to advance the NSA mission to gather signals intelligence and protect our Nation's Defense Industrial Base and critical infrastructure. These leaders are adept at working across organizations with competing priorities to build consensus to achieve mission outcomes. These leaders actively engage in diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility efforts to advance NSA's mission; show respect and appreciation for the unique skills, knowledge, abilities and perspectives of all colleagues; and, model inclusive behavior that enables everyone to contribute their fullest to the mission.",

These on-the-job operational tours are primarily focused on analyzing foreign language materials within the framework of the two main SIGINT disciplines of intelligence analysis - SIGINT reporting and SIGINT development. \n\nCross-Training Program (Language Enhancement or Acquisition):\nThe Language Analysis Cross Training Program is designed to cross-train individuals in the acquisition of another language, or enhance an existing language, which is critically needed to fulfill NSA's mission. Optimally qualified candidates will have already demonstrated the ability to attain advanced proficiency in a foreign language as an adult learner. After successful completion of the Cross-Training program, most graduates will enter the Language Analysis Development Program (LADP), which lasts up to three years.\n\n\nMDLAs are at the forefront of carrying out NSA's SIGINT mission, and they do so in a variety of ways:\n-\tOffer U.S. policymakers and military leaders a window into the foreign language world of intelligence targets by analyzing, transcribing, and translating key information\n-\tResearch and understand foreign intelligence targets, how they operate, and how they fit in the larger geo-political context\n-\tApply new techniques and develop creative solutions to address analytic problems such as synthesizing large volumes of data and disparate sources of information\n-\tDemonstrate a firm understanding of the communications environment and technology trends of foreign intelligence targets\n-\tCraft written and oral assessments of foreign intelligence that provide unique insights into target intentions unavailable from other intelligence disciplines\n-\tWork independently and collaborate effectively (both within NSA and with other analysts in the Intelligence Community) in research, analysis, and reporting",
