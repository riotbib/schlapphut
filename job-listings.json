LPS is a partnership between NSA and the University of Maryland. The focus of researchers at LPS is the physics and engineering behind information science and technology, including advanced communication, sensing, and computing technologies. \n\nWithin LPS is the office of Solid State and Quantum Physics, where we elucidate the fundamental behavior of quantum devices and related technologies by working across the US Government to drive world-class research at universities, companies, and national labs.  This advancement is made by developing modeling and simulation tools to explore and assess new ideas discovered by LPS and others.  Our goal is to identify and answer challenging scientific questions in order to provide meaningful advice on the feasibility of and challenges confronting quantum computing.  Our customers include the NSA, the Intelligence Community, the Department of Defense, and the broader U.S. Government.  LPS also plays a leading role in policy-making through engagements across Government.\n\nLPS is seeking a diverse set of scientists with experience in modeling and simulation, who are driven to push the frontiers of science.  Our researchers work in a fast-paced team environment where university, industry, and federal government scientists collaborate on research in quantum and cryogenic devices to advance the state-of-the-art in communication, sensing, and computer technologies.\n\nLPS is excited to leverage your expertise, ideas, and vision as a Modeling and Simulation Researcher.  You will lead research in modeling and simulation of quantum information systems and devices, with the goal of gaining a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of various arrangements of quantum systems that can provide advantage over classical alternatives for computation and sensing.\n\nA successful candidate should have excellent problem-solving, communication, and interpersonal skills, and possess a range of knowledge and experience in at least two of the following areas:\n- Several layers of a quantum information system hierarchy, with an emphasis on logical functionality (e.g., fault tolerant methods, sensor network design, quantum algorithm development in the circuit model paradigm, etc.);\n- Physical constraints on quantum systems, including the impact of noise and other error sources;\n- Modeling and/or simulation to include ab initio software development, as well as the ability to leverage existing software, using languages such as Python and C++;\n- Quantum characterization (e.g., randomized benchmarking, tomographic methods, etc.).\n- Modeling and simulation of physical systems and familiarity with numerical techniques, domain decomposition, Monte Carlo simulation, and statistical analysis",
