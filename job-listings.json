At NSA OGC, you will analyze cutting-edge technical and intelligence issues and will frequently provide legal advice that relates to high-profile current events affecting our national security.\n\nAttorneys working in NSA OGC apply their expertise, skills, and education to solve a variety of challenges not found in the private sector or at any other government agency. You will have the opportunity to make a global impact on a daily basis as you work with other top caliber professionals at the highest levels of the Agency and across the U.S. Government. This critical work ensures that Agency operations comply with the law while also protecting both our national security and our civil liberties. \n\nBecause the twin missions of NSA - signals intelligence and cybersecurity - encompass counterterrorism and cybersecurity, two of the most important and dynamic challenges our Government faces today, there is rarely a typical day for an NSA attorney. We are routinely presented with exciting and novel legal issues at the intersection of technology and law.\n\nIn tackling these challenges, our attorneys work directly with senior officials at various Intelligence Community and Executive Branch agencies, as well as with relevant committees of Congress.\n\nNSA attorneys work in a highly classified setting and are entrusted with tremendous responsibility as they advise the Director and other senior leaders at the Agency on a diverse and complex spectrum of issues related to gathering the foreign intelligence information needed to fight international terrorism, espionage, transnational crime, and narcotics, to defeat foreign cyber adversaries trying to steal national secrets, and to provide intelligence support to critical military overseas tactical operations, all while protecting our civil liberties and ensuring strict compliance with the Constitution and our laws. Because the NSA is a Department of Defense agency, our attorneys have a unique opportunity to be directly involved in national security operations working alongside military and civilian colleagues, as well as to interact with the private sector in cybersecurity and other matters.\n\nIn short, many OGC attorneys say they can't imagine working in a more exciting and important position.\n\nNSA OGC has several exciting and challenging career opportunities available in a range of legal practice groups that provide advice in the areas of: Intelligence Operations; Procurement; Research and Development; Information Security; Environmental Law, Patents, Telecommunications; Security matters; Litigation; Acquisition, Research & Technology Law; and Administrative Law & Ethics. \n\nThe responsibilities of an Attorney at the NSA can include:\n\n- Advising the Agency on legal matters involving a particular subject matter (e.g., intelligence operations, procurement, research and development, information security, patents, security matters, legislation, employment/personnel issues, ethics, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Privacy Act (PA), or Federal Records Act (FRA) questions)\n- Analyzing legislation, programs, policies, regulations, or plans to determine impact on the Agency\n- Representing the Agency's official position in legal and legislative proceedings\n- Representing the Agency in interactions with outside customers, DoD, Congressional representatives, foreign partners, or the general public\n- Conferring with/educating clients, customers, or stakeholders on legal or policy issues\n- Determining the legal sufficiency of documents\n- Drafting legal briefs, pleadings, etc\n- Making legal determinations in accordance with laws, regulations, professional standards, or Agency policies and procedures\n\nAppointment to this position requires a minimum commitment of 2 year(s) in OGC before you can be eligible to apply for any other positions at the Agency.\n\nAFTER SUBMITTING YOUR ELECTRONIC APPLICATION, you will receive an email with instructions on how to submit the following supplemental information:\n- Cover letter\n- Professional resume\n- Legal writing sample (short, <15 pages)\n- Unofficial law school transcript \n- Past professional references (approximately three; include name, title, phone number, and email). Current employer references will only be required after a successful interview is completed.\n\nThis email will come from a member of the OGC Hiring Team from a uwe.nsa.gov account.

    "jobRequirements": "About the Practicum Program\n\nThe Employee Assistance Services (EAS) is the psychological treatment division of the National Security Agency (NSA).  It offers clinical services to all Agency employees and their spouses.  EAS is an ideal setting for practicum students to gain relevant experience working with a wide variety of presenting concerns and a broad range of diagnoses.  The EAS clientele also offers the opportunity to work with diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds.  The 9-12 month practicum placement is designed for three doctoral students in psychology who are interested in developing their clinical skills and building their knowledge base.  The practical application of this knowledge is in the treatment of a diverse workforce within the federal government's Intelligence Community. \nThe 9-12 month practicum placement requires approximately 16-20 hours per week, dependent on the practicum students interests and the requirements of their respective graduate program (this includes administrative responsibilities and supervision preparation).  Practicum students are responsible for ensuring that their hours meet criteria for their respective programs.  The following is a tentative outline of weekly activities.\n\n1.\tIndividual Therapy (7-8 hours per week).  Clients will generally be seen once a week with a ten-session limit.  Some cases may be more appropriate for biweekly counseling, which can be arranged.  Practicum students will be provided with a private office at EAS in which they will see clients.  Practicum students will carry 7-10 individual therapy clients at a time.\n\n2.\tGroup Therapy.  Practicum students will be provided with the opportunity to participate in co-facilitation of group therapy with a licensed EAS staff clinician.  The types and dates of groups offered at EAS at any given time vary and are dependent on the EAS staff clinician offering the group. \n\n3.\tIndividual and Group Supervision (2 hours per week).  Each practicum student will have one or two direct clinical supervisors for all client cases, at least one of which will be a licensed clinical psychologist.  Additionally, a multi-disciplinary consultation team will be made available to the practicum student in formal and informal ways in order to provide an opportunity for the practicum student to be exposed to various treatment modalities and theoretical orientations.\n\n4.\tIntake evaluation.  Learning to evaluate the client and the client's situation so as to help the client make the most of their counseling is essential to the work at EAS.  Practicum students will conduct an intake evaluation with clients prior to starting individual therapy.  This evaluation will be conducted with a supervisor available at all times during the intake for consultation as needed, and will allow for the practicum student and supervisor to determine whether or not a particular client is appropriate for the practicum student to manage in individual therapy.  At least once per semester, direct observation of an intake evaluation will occur in which the student and the supervisor will both be present in the room.\n\n5.\tClinical Meeting (1.5 hours per week; Wednesdays 1:00PM - 2:30PM).  Practicum students meet with the clinical staff to present cases and to discuss particular problems or issues related to their work with clients.  At least once per semester, they will be asked to give a formal case presentation to the clinical staff on a client which poses a particular challenge.\n\n6.\tWorkplace Consultations/Corporate Outreach.  Each practicum student will participate in at least one workplace consultation/outreach activity for the workforce.  Practicum students are encouraged to complete this in the fall semester.\n\n7.\tSeminar (1.5 hours per week; Wednesdays 11:30AM - 1:00PM).   Practicum students are required to attend the Selected Topics & Clinical Application Seminar.  This seminar (conducted by staff members and visiting clinicians) focuses on a number of clinical areas in depth including: theories; application of theory; and other clinical topics (e.g., workplace consultations, substance abuse, collaboration within a work environment, work-life issues).  Readings for the seminars are generally assigned in advance of class (all reading materials provided by EAS).  During the course of the practicum placement, the practicum students will be asked to present a journal article.\n\n8.\tEvaluation and Feedback.  Feedback on progress will be provided in individual supervision as well as more formally throughout each semester.  Practicum students are evaluated based on their ability to establish rapport with clients, integrate theory and practice, and intervene with clients.\n\nApplication Deadline:\nApplications for the 2025/2026 program are accepted 15 November 2024 - 15 January 2025.",
