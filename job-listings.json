NGA's civilian, military and contract personnel evaluate imagery, maps, charts, multiple layers of foundation data - such as terrain, elevation and gravity - and the full spectrum of visible and invisible light in order to help users visualize what is happening at a particular place and time. Our intelligence officers go beyond describing 'what, where and when' to revealing 'how and why' our work enables decision advantage for our policymakers, warfighters, intelligence professionals and first responders. NGA uses a flexible, high mobility career model.\n\nIndividuals are hired for their overall skills within a specialty such as Visual Information Specialist, and then placed in various positions throughout the agency once they complete the clearance process. Although currently advertised as a supervisory, permanent, telework-eligible job posting with occasional travel, it is unknown which specific positions will be available after applicants complete the selection and clearance process. Because of this, aspects of the job such as travel, supervisory, telework, etc., may change, depending on specific positions available at that time. It is also possible that applicants could be hired into a position with specific aspects and then change positions after serving for a period of time in that assignment. Applicants who have completed the clearance process receive final documentation about the nature of the specific position before they make the final commitment to join NGA. NGA seeks Graphic Designers who are experts in visual storytelling to design worldclass graphical content to support various missions. Graphic Designers should be comfortable working with complex spatial and non-spatial GEOINT data on frequently technical subjects. Being able to take complex stories that are technical in nature and distill them into easy-to-understand visuals (to a non-expert audience) is key to being successful in this position. Also key are critical thinking skills and the ability to transition quickly from different products of completely different scope, design medium, and subject matter. The Graphic Designer must possess strong organizational, oral communication, writing, and planning skills to manage the workflow of projects and the coordination with other technical disciplines to meet customer deadlines. Additionally, the Graphic Designer must be able to work equally well independently or on a team and have strong technical skills to mentor other employees on graphic procedures.\n\nAdditional Application Requirement: You may be asked to complete one or more assessments in addition to the application you submit on this website as part of your application to NGA.

    "jobPositionSummary": "ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION: Cartographers acquire, compile, evaluate, and review geospatial data to develop cartography products and/or data holdings in support of mission requirements for national security, military operations, and humanitarian relief. They extract, attribute, format, manipulate, and symbolize geospatial information in accordance with NGA and international standards, typically specializing in a particular cartography domain (e.g., topographical, nautical). Topographic Cartographers analyze data sources (e.g., aerial photography, satellite images) to extract land surface features as foundation data, finish and symbolize topographic maps, and ensure finished products (e.g., Topographic and NAVPLAN products) meet safety, usability, and readability thresholds. Nautical Cartographers research, acquire, and evaluate data sources (e.g., imagery, nautical charts, hydrographic and bathymetric surveys, ship reports, Notices to Mariners) to extract and attribute land, littoral, and sea features critical for safe navigation in a littoral or sea-based environment. Cartographers ensure the quality, accuracy, and currency of geospatial information produced internally or by external partners or contractors. They also regularly engage customers and partners to improve processes, as well as contribute to the modernization of the cartography tradecraft and development of GEOINT standards.",
