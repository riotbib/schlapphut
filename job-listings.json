This critical work ensures that Agency operations comply with the law while also protecting both our national security and our civil liberties. \n\nBecause the twin missions of NSA - signals intelligence and cybersecurity - encompass counterterrorism and cybersecurity, two of the most important and dynamic challenges our Government faces today, there is rarely a typical day for an NSA attorney.

If so, this position may be the perfect fit for you.\n\n-  Enjoy abstract puzzles and other problem-solving challenges\n-  Tinkering with hardware or have technological curiosity\n-  Reverse engineering of hardware or equipment, such as disassembling or repair\n-  Appreciation and interest in weaponry systems, rockets, or other aerial projectiles\n-  Interest in clandestine intelligence activities\n-  Open to applying your skills in new and nontraditional ways\n-  Desire to help NSA/DoD in accomplishing missions\n\n\nResponsibilities of Target Systems Analysts may include:\n\n- Derive performance characteristics, capabilities, and limitations of a target system (often a weapon or space system) and its employment in military theaters by analyzing its emanated signals and performing additional data analysis as necessary.\n- Produce intelligence on characteristics, behavior, tactics and trends of the system and signals.",
