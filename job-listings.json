They do so in a variety of ways: \n\n- Leverage NSA's unique capabilities to understand and mitigate global Cyber threats \n- Research foreign intelligence targets and their geo-political environment\n- Apply new techniques and develop creative solutions to address analytic problems such as synthesizing large volumes of data and disparate sources of information\n- Understand communications technology and burgeoning commercial and foreign intelligence target technology trends\n- Craft written assessments of foreign intelligence that provide unique insight into target intentions unavailable from other intelligence disciplines\n- Collaborate effectively (both within NSA and with the Intelligence Community) to further NSA missions",
