The program includes 4-5 operational tours in a variety of offices, interspersed with formal classroom and computer-based training. These on-the-job operational tours are primarily focused on analyzing foreign language materials within the framework of the two main SIGINT disciplines of intelligence analysis - SIGINT reporting and SIGINT development. \n\nCross-Training Program (Language Enhancement or Acquisition):\nThe Language Analysis Cross Training Program is designed to cross-train individuals in the acquisition of another language, or enhance an existing language, which is critically needed to fulfill NSA's mission. Optimally qualified candidates will have already demonstrated the ability to attain advanced proficiency in a foreign language as an adult learner.
