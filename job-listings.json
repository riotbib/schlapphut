At NSA OGC, you will analyze cutting-edge technical and intelligence issues and will frequently provide legal advice that relates to high-profile current events affecting our national security.\n\nAttorneys working in NSA OGC apply their expertise, skills, and education to solve a variety of challenges not found in the private sector or at any other government agency. You will have the opportunity to make a global impact on a daily basis as you work with other top caliber professionals at the highest levels of the Agency and across the U.S. Government. This critical work ensures that Agency operations comply with the law while also protecting both our national security and our civil liberties. \n\nBecause the twin missions of NSA - signals intelligence and cybersecurity - encompass counterterrorism and cybersecurity, two of the most important and dynamic challenges our Government faces today, there is rarely a typical day for an NSA attorney. We are routinely presented with exciting and novel legal issues at the intersection of technology and law.\n\nIn tackling these challenges, our attorneys work directly with senior officials at various Intelligence Community and Executive Branch agencies, as well as with relevant committees of Congress.\n\nNSA attorneys work in a highly classified setting and are entrusted with tremendous responsibility as they advise the Director and other senior leaders at the Agency on a diverse and complex spectrum of issues related to gathering the foreign intelligence information needed to fight international terrorism, espionage, transnational crime, and narcotics, to defeat foreign cyber adversaries trying to steal national secrets, and to provide intelligence support to critical military overseas tactical operations, all while protecting our civil liberties and ensuring strict compliance with the Constitution and our laws. Because the NSA is a Department of Defense agency, our attorneys have a unique opportunity to be directly involved in national security operations working alongside military and civilian colleagues, as well as to interact with the private sector in cybersecurity and other matters.\n\nIn short, many OGC attorneys say they can't imagine working in a more exciting and important position.\n\nNSA OGC has several exciting and challenging career opportunities available in a range of legal practice groups that provide advice in the areas of: Intelligence Law; Information Assurance Law; Legislation; Litigation; Acquisition, Research & Technology Law; Law & Policy; and Administrative Law & Ethics. \n\nDescription of Position\nThe responsibilities of an Attorney at the NSA can include:\n\n- Advising the Agency on legal matters involving a particular subject matter (e.g., intelligence operations, procurement, research and development, information security, patents, security matters, legislation, employment/personnel issues, ethics, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Privacy Act (PA), or Federal Records Act (FRA) questions)\n- Analyzing legislation, programs, policies, regulations, or plans to determine impact on the Agency\n- Representing the Agency's official position in legal and legislative proceedings\n- Representing the Agency in interactions with outside customers, DoD, Congressional representatives, foreign partners, or the general public\n- Conferring with/educating clients, customers, or stakeholders on legal or policy issues\n- Determining the legal sufficiency of documents\n- Drafting legal briefs, pleadings, etc\n- Making legal determinations in accordance with laws, regulations, professional standards, or Agency policies and procedures\n\nAppointment to this position requires a minimum commitment of 2 year(s) in OGC before you can be eligible to apply for any other positions at the Agency.\n\nAFTER SUBMITTING YOUR ELECTRONIC APPLICATION, you will receive an email with instructions on how to submit the following supplemental information:\n- Cover letter\n- Professional resume\n- Legal writing sample (short, <15 pages)\n- Unofficial law school transcript \n- Past professional references (approximately three; include name, title, phone number, and email). Current employer references will only be required after a successful interview is completed.\n\nThis email will come from a member of the OGC Hiring Team from a uwe.nsa.gov account.

    "jobRequirements": "NSA's Linguists, known as Multidisciplined Language Analysts (MDLAs), are expected to take an inclusive approach to problem solving and mission accomplishment by frequently engaging with partners, enablers, and customers across the Intelligence Community. \n\nBased on skill level and experience, NSA MDLAs are considered for either the Language Analysis Development Program (LADP), or the Cross-Training (language acquisition or language enhancement) Program which allows development of Chinese, Russian and Persian Farsi language expertise to support NSA mission; or in the case of MDLAs with extensive experience in Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), directly into positions supporting an analytic mission office.\nLADP:\n\nThe LADP, which lasts up to three years, is designed to provide an intensive, accelerated opportunity to acquire the unique technical skills and experience needed to successfully apply knowledge and analytic ability to the SIGINT mission and help MDLAs achieve core analytic competencies in accordance with the Cryptologic Training System Training Standard and the MDLA competencies framework. The program includes 4-5 operational tours in a variety of offices, interspersed with formal classroom and computer-based training. These on-the-job operational tours are primarily focused on analyzing foreign language materials within the framework of the two main SIGINT disciplines of intelligence analysis - SIGINT reporting and SIGINT development. \n\nCross-Training Program (Language Enhancement or Acquisition):\nThe Language Analysis Cross Training Program is designed to cross-train individuals in the acquisition of another language which is critically needed to fulfill NSA's mission. Optimally qualified candidates will have already demonstrated the ability to attain advanced proficiency in a foreign language as an adult learner. After successful completion of the Cross-Training program, most graduates will enter the Language Analysis Development Program (LADP), which lasts up to three years.\n\nMDLAs are at the forefront of carrying out NSA's SIGINT mission, and they do so in a variety of ways:\n-\tOffer U.S. policymakers and military leaders a window into the foreign language world of intelligence targets by analyzing, transcribing, and translating key information\n-\tResearch and understand foreign intelligence targets, how they operate, and how they fit in the larger geo-political context\n-\tApply new techniques and develop creative solutions to address analytic problems such as synthesizing large volumes of data and disparate sources of information\n-\tDemonstrate a firm understanding of the communications environment and technology trends of foreign intelligence targets\n-\tCraft written and oral assessments of foreign intelligence that provide unique insights into target intentions unavailable from other intelligence disciplines\n-\tWork independently and collaborate effectively (both within NSA and with other analysts in the Intelligence Community) in research, analysis, and reporting",
