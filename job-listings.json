    "jobRequirements": "About the Practicum Program\n\nThe Employee Assistance Services (EAS) is the psychological treatment division of the National Security Agency (NSA).  It offers clinical services to all employees and their spouses.  EAS is an ideal setting for practicum students to gain relevant experience working with a wide variety of presenting concerns and a broad range of diagnoses.  The EAS clientele also offers the opportunity to work with diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds.  The 9-12 month practicum placement is designed for three doctoral students in psychology who are interested in developing their clinical skills and building their knowledge base.  The practical application of this knowledge is in the treatment of a diverse workforce within the federal government's Intelligence Community. \n\nThe 9-12 month practicum placement requires approximately 16-20 hours per week, dependent on the practicum students' interests and the requirements of their respective graduate program (this includes administrative responsibilities and supervision preparation).  Practicum students are responsible for ensuring that their hours meet criteria for their respective programs.  The following is a tentative outline of weekly activities.\n\n1.\tIndividual Therapy (7-8 hours per week).  Clients will generally be seen once a week with a ten-session limit.  Some cases may be more appropriate for biweekly counseling, which can be arranged.  Practicum students will be provided with a private office at EAS in which they will see clients.  Practicum students will carry 7-10 individual therapy clients at a time.\n\n2.\tSupervision on Individual Therapy Cases (2 hours per week).  Each practicum student will have one or two direct clinical supervisors for individual therapy cases, at least one of which will be a licensed clinical psychologist.  Additionally, a multi-disciplinary consultation team will be made available to the practicum student in formal and informal ways in order to provide an opportunity for the practicum student to be exposed to various treatment modalities and theoretical orientations.\n\n3.\tIntake evaluation.  Learning to evaluate the client and the client's situation so as to help the client make the most of his or her counseling is essential to the work at EAS.  Practicum students will conduct an intake evaluation with clients prior to starting individual therapy.  This evaluation will be conducted under supervision and will allow for the practicum student and supervisor to determine whether or not a particular client is appropriate for the practicum student to manage in individual therapy.  At least once per semester, direct observation of an intake evaluation will occur in which the student and the supervisor will both be present in the room.\n\n4.\tUrgent Care Coverage/Crisis Intervention (2 hours per week for 1 semester).  Practicum students will be given the opportunity to provide urgent care coverage for two hours per week for one semester.  To prepare for this experience, all practicum students will participate in an orientation that will cover a range of topics, including how to provide urgent care support, risk assessment, and treatment planning.\n\n5.\tClinical Meeting (1.5 hours per week; Wednesdays 1:00 - 2:30PM).  Practicum students meet with the clinical staff to present cases and to discuss particular problems or issues related to their work with clients.  At least once per semester, they will be asked to give a formal case presentation to the clinical staff on a client which poses a particular challenge.\n\n6.\tWorkplace Consultations/Corporate Outreach.  Each practicum student will participate in at least one workplace consultation/outreach activity for the workforce.  Practicum students are encouraged to complete this in the fall semester.\n\n7.\tSeminar (1.5 hours per week; Wednesdays 11:30 AM ' 1:00 PM).   Practicum students are required to attend the 'Selected Topics & Clinical Application Seminar.'  This seminar (conducted by staff members and visiting clinicians) focuses on a number of clinical areas in depth including: theories; application of theory; and other clinical topics (e.g., workplace consultations, substance abuse, collaboration within a work environment, worklife issues).  Readings for the seminars are generally assigned in advance of class (all reading materials provided by EAS).  During the course of the practicum placement, the practicum students will be asked to present a journal article.\n\n8.\tEvaluation and Feedback.  Feedback on progress will be provided in individual supervision as well as more formally throughout each semester.  Practicum students are evaluated based on their ability to establish rapport with clients, integrate theory and practice, and intervene with clients.\n\nApplication Deadline\n\nApplications for the 2024/2025 program are accepted 15 November 2023 - 15 January 2024.",

World-class technical professionals solve challenging systems engineering problems with unprecedented speed and scale utilizing innovative solutions. Systems engineers perform trade studies to generate and translate conceptual designs into technical specifications, participate in the evaluation of prototype hardware systems and software solutions, and integrate into the current architecture.  Backgrounds such as Cybersecurity, SIGINT, hybrid-cloud, machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), integrated network architecture, information technology infrastructure and hybrid-communications all have a place in the spectrum of implementations ranging from commercial/government off-the-self solutions to the development of new and unique technologies.\n\nSENIOR SYSTEMS ENGINEERS\n\nSeasoned professionals drive the Agency's largest and most challenging technical projects to ensure success. These engineers participate in technical decision-making, or function in an advisory role. Working in collaborative teams, these professionals define and manage technical requirements throughout product lifecycle; identify and manage technical program risk; evaluate the architectural design for efficiency improvements; capture, analyze and recommend updates to the enterprise and mission architectures to ensure resiliency; design and enforce configuration management and interoperability standards; and define, manage and perform testing and evaluation. Senior Systems Engineers mentor other systems engineers in their tradecraft, which lays the foundation for future successes.\n\nMID-CAREER SYSTEMS ENGINEERS\n\nMid-career systems engineers have experience leading systems engineering efforts, and are ready to apply, or expand that knowledge in the Intelligence Community. These engineers have experience in specific lifecycle phases, as well as an understanding of the full lifecycle. They develop their expertise, grow their breadth of knowledge, and mentor the next generation of systems engineers. Mid-career systems engineers come from a wide variety of experiences such as Cybersecurity, SIGINT, communications, and systems of systems or networking infrastructure. These professionals are adept at communicating with technical teams, and making recommendations to senior leadership that drive mission initiatives.\n\nJUNIOR SYSTEMS ENGINEERS\n\nNSA hires recent college graduates and junior systems engineers to support a technical mission office, or participate in a Development Program. These systems engineers are involved in various projects that are designed to nurture and grow their skills. They gain hands-on, practical knowledge of architecture and infrastructure by designing engineering systems over the lifecycle in areas such as Cybersecurity, SIGINT, networks, servers, hardware and software. Supported by robust training, junior systems engineers have opportunities to form relationships with mentors and explore possibilities. They are energetic, motivated, driven to continual learning and ready to grow their careers.",
