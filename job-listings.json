    "jobRequirements": "With the ever-accelerating technological advances and growing system complexity, NSA needs Hardware/Software Engineers to design, develop, construct and evaluate electronic hardware and software processing components. These components are typically subsystems of communication, collection, processing or analysis systems. \n\nHardware Software Engineers utilize electrical, computer, mechanical, and materials engineering knowledge and skills to design, assemble, test, analyze and reverse engineer electronics hardware in support of the NSA mission.\n\nThe National Security Agency (NSA) currently has opportunities for two types of Hardware/Software Engineers positions: Hardware/Software Design Engineers, and Hardware/Software Analysis Engineers. Applicants may also be considered for NSA Development Programs. \n\n1.  HARDWARE/SOFTWARE DESIGN ENGINEERS are hired into positions supporting a broad range of specialized skills including Computer Engineering, Computer Programming, Computer Software Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Communications Engineering. Positions will be in an office directly supporting a technical mission. \n\nThe responsibilities of a Hardware/Software Design Engineer may include: \n-  Designing, developing, testing, and/or evaluating computer or computer-related equipment. \n-  Designing, developing, testing and evaluation of programmable hardware devices or digital circuits.\n-  Programming, modifying and/or configuring system software that manages the computer hardware and provides services to the applications.\n-  Applying software engineering principles to design, develop, test, and evaluate/modify software applications.\n\n2.  HARDWARE/SOFTWARE ANALYSIS ENGINEERS are hired into positions supporting a broad range of specialized skills including Computer Science, Software Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Telecommunications Engineering and Applied Mathematics. Positions will be in an office directly supporting a technical mission.\n\nThe responsibilities of a Hardware/Software Analysis Engineer may include: \n-  Design, develop, construct, test, or analyze firmware, hardware or software components.\n-  Develop new or utilize existing methods and tools to analyze or protect specific hardware, software or firmware. \n-  Develop/recommend mitigation strategies and techniques.\n-  Develop and implement hardware forensic methodologies and applications.\n-  Test, evaluate and/or reverse engineer microelectronic components (FPGA, ASICs, PCB, Microcontrollers, etc.), technology and equipment. \n-  Program, modify and analyze system software/tools that control microelectronics hardware.\n-  Apply hardware and software engineering principles to design, develop, test, and evaluate/modify applications and systems.\n \nNSA DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\nApplicants may be considered for one of three Development Programs: the Resident Signals Engineering Program (RSE), System Engineer Development Program (SEDP) or the Applied Computing Development Program (ACDP).\n\n1.  The RSE Program is a 4-year technical development program focused on the collection, processing, and analysis of signals in any environment and in any media. The RSE Program offers selected technical personnel unique opportunities for self-directed diversity tours in core mission areas where they will learn about, and provide solutions for, many of the toughest technical problems facing the Agency. \n\n2.  The SEDP prepares recent college graduates (engineering-related degrees) for a career in systems engineering at NSA. Applying systems engineering tradecraft and building a network while working with leading NSA experts prepares SEDP engineers for advanced or leadership assignments. The SEDP covers the breadth of systems engineering core competencies, including technical/analytical, technical management, and organizational/business processes. During the three-year full-time program, SEDP engineers rotate assignments to gain exposure to various NSA mission areas, attend systems engineering training and visits throughout the IC, and earn DoD DAWIA and other important credentials. \n\n3.  The ACDP is a three-year full-time development program designed to provide entry-level information technology specialists (that is, individuals with degrees in computer science, engineering, computer security, information systems, information technology, and related degrees and experience) the opportunity to acquire the skills and technical capabilities necessary to successfully execute NSA's mission. In this program, participants gain a depth of knowledge in a breadth of information technology disciplines, including system/security, software engineering, software project management, and system architecture. ACDP participants work in teams and with NSA technical leaders to solve current and future challenging IT problems.",

World-class technical professionals solve challenging systems engineering problems with unprecedented speed and scale utilizing innovative solutions. Systems engineers perform trade studies to generate and translate conceptual designs into technical specifications, participate in the evaluation of prototype hardware systems and software solutions, and integrate into the current architecture.  Backgrounds such as Cybersecurity, SIGINT, hybrid-cloud, machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), integrated network architecture, information technology infrastructure and hybrid-communications all have a place in the spectrum of implementations ranging from commercial/government off-the-shelf solutions to the development of new and unique technologies.\n\nSENIOR SYSTEMS ENGINEERS\n\nSeasoned professionals drive the Agency's largest and most challenging technical projects to ensure success. These engineers participate in technical decision-making, or function in an advisory role. Working in collaborative teams, these professionals define and manage technical requirements throughout product lifecycle; identify and manage technical program risk; evaluate the architectural design for efficiency improvements; capture, analyze and recommend updates to the enterprise and mission architectures to ensure resiliency; design and enforce configuration management and interoperability standards; and define, manage and perform testing and evaluation. Senior Systems Engineers mentor other systems engineers in their tradecraft, which lays the foundation for future successes.\n\nMID-CAREER SYSTEMS ENGINEERS\n\nMid-career systems engineers have experience leading systems engineering efforts, and are ready to apply, or expand that knowledge in the Intelligence Community. These engineers have experience in specific lifecycle phases, as well as an understanding of the full lifecycle. They develop their expertise, grow their breadth of knowledge, and mentor the next generation of systems engineers.

At the end of the day, our job is to keep the Nation safe and informed about potential threats from foreign adversaries. \n\nCryptanalysis, or codebreaking, is at the heart of NSA. Cryptanalysts monitor, collect, and process encrypted communications from foreign nations who may post a threat to the United States. We perform the cryptanalytic mission on encrypted foreign collection containing bespoke encryption algorithms and strong commercial cryptography. Additionally, cryptanalysts provide solutions to authenticate and enable computer network exploitation of the United States' foreign adversaries. Our outcomes yield the highest impact intelligence and security outcomes for NSA and the Nation.  \n\nWe have incredible teams made up of analysts with varying backgrounds including mathematics, data science, computer science, engineering, and statistics. If you would like use your background to be a part of the exciting organization that collects, processes, and makes encrypted information intelligible to NSA's customers, hit JOIN THE MISSION--APPLY NOW.\n\nPlease Note:  A copy of unofficial transcripts for all college courses must be submitted with the application in order for the application to be considered.",
